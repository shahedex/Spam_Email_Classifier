Dear Joyce,

Your effort on behalf of the Boys and Girls Club to engage our staff in a worthwhile charitable event is noteworthy. Your participation in the organization of the silent auction, the buffet appetizers, the cocktail hour, and locating speakers provided our company with significant positive press in the local community.

When my wife and I attended the event, several people thanked me for providing company resources to assist with the event. Your time and commitment stand out, but you also recruited 15 other staff members.

Everywhere we went at the event, our staff was helping due to your recruiting and commitment to the charitable cause.

Our employees were parking cars, delivering and recording silent auction wins, greeting guests, running the coat check, and more. The company logo on their sweaters was a nice touch, too, as all attendees saw the level of support that we provided at the event due to your charitable contributions.


It feels good to know that your efforts set a fund raising record for the club. I wanted to take the time to tell you that we deeply appreciate your charitable contributions of time, energy, and talent to such a worthy cause on our behalf.

Thank you.

Bill

On Behalf of Your Exec Team
